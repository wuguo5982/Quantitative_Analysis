##  1. Core Focus Areas

- **Anomaly & Fraud Detection**  
  Detection of abnormal patterns and fraudulent activity in financial loans and transactions using intelligent ML/AI models.

- **Credit Risk Prediction**  
  Credit default prediction using statistical and machine learning techniques.

- **Market & Customer Segmentation**  
  Clustering customer segments to support targeted marketing, personalized services, and strategic product development.

- **Customer Churn Prediction and  Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Estimation**
  - Forecasting attrition risk to optimize retention strategies and reduce customer loss.
  - Predicting long-term customer value to drive investment and acquisition strategies.
